This project was developed as part of the Artificial Intelligence course and focuses on the implementation of the Simulated Annealing optimization algorithm. 
The objective was to solve an optimization problem by exploring the solution space and progressively improving results using probabilistic techniques. 
The algorithm applies temperature-based state transitions to escape local optima and converge towards near-optimal solutions. 
The project emphasizes heuristic search, algorithm design, performance analysis and problem-solving skills in an academic context.
